        <abstract abstracttype="Standard"><![CDATA[ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207-2 provides the mapping expressing corresponding relations between software life cycle processes in ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 and the processes in the previous edition ISO/IEC 12207:2008. These relations are demonstrated by means of mapping tables that show relationships between Process Outcomes, and Activities and Tasks in these both editions of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207. This mapping assists users of the ISO/IEC 12207:2008 edition to transition to using the ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 edition. This document will help users understand the differences between the reference processes and requirements of the two editions of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207, and help the user to understand any potential gaps or process enhancements might be needed in seeking conformance to, and/or use of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017. Also, this document provides to such users the mapping which helps to identify corresponding and compatible process outcomes, activities and tasks of processes for software systems in the ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017.]]></abstract>

The mapping between ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 and ISO/IEC 12207:2008 in this document can be used as a basis to continuously conduct, improve and extend current process assets including software specific process assets based on ISO/IEC 12207:2008 for effective implementation]]></articlestdscope>
        <articlestdpurpose><![CDATA[Users should apply this document to map between their current software life cycle processes consistent with ISO/IEC 12207:2008 and the processes, activities, and tasks required by ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017. The user may define and document user implemented processes differently from either ISO/IEC 12207:2008 or ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017. Then, the mapping tables of this document may be modified with additional user process information, when the userâ€™s processes are mapped to the reference processes of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 in order to claim conformance with that standard. This document will help users (who are presumably users of ISO/IEC 12207:2008 as well) to understand the similarities and differences between the reference process definitions and requirements contained in ISO/IEC 12207:2008 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 and then to help map their own implemented lifecycle processes to ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017. Where ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 requirements (at the level of processes, outcomes, activities or tasks) differ from those in ISO/IEC 12207:2008, the user will be able to identify elements (again at the level of processes, activities or tasks) which have gaps or will not meet the requirements for conformance with ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017. Users can identify corresponding process outcomes, activities or tasks from the mapping tables in Clause 6. This document has none of conformance requirements. However, process outcome or activity/task mapping of this document can be used to support conformance to ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017. Such a case is stated in Clause 1. The following are typical use cases when users of this document can apply mappings: --users can understand which processes, outcomes, activities, or tasks of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 cover or subsume the outcomes, activities, or tasks of processes (including software specific processes) of ISO/IEC 12207:2008; --users can identify outcomes, activities, or tasks of processes (including software specific processes) of ISO/IEC 12207:2008 that are to be continuously conducted, enhanced, extended or improved to meet the requirements of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 and/or to demonstrate achievement of required outcomes, activities and tasks of the software life cycle processes.]]></articlestdpurpose>
